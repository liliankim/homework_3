## Overview
​
### The challenge
Create a random password generator with specific parameters

​
### Acceptance Criteria
​ -password to be at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
 - parameters to be set for uppercase, lowercase, and numeric/symbol  characters
​
## My process
​First I tried to understand how we are utilizing Javascript to complete this task. I understood this assignment as calling Javascript elements and using if statements to determine certain parameters that I wanted for the password generator.
### Built with
​
-Javascript
​
​
### What I learned
​
I learned that Javascript can be quite a complete coding system.
I learned that there isn't just one way to compelte Javascript codes.

​
### Continued development
​
I was having a very hard time applying what I had learned into my code.
I think that I need to do more hands on practice to make sure that the codes that I call actually execute those codes and do not break.
​
### Useful resources
​
-W3 Schools
This website has a very detailed and varied explanation of all the Javascript terms and properties.
